# MOEA Design Justification

## Algorithm Selection

### 1. Why MOEA/D?

#### Theoretical Advantages
Based on extensive research in evolutionary computation:

1. **Decomposition Principle**
   - Transforms multi-objective problem into multiple single-objective subproblems
   - Proven convergence properties (Zhang & Li, 2007)
   - Efficient handling of many objectives (Deb & Jain, 2014)

2. **Neighborhood Structure**
   - Localized information sharing
   - Reduced computational complexity
   - Better exploration-exploitation balance (Li et al., 2009)

3. **Solution Diversity**
   - Systematic weight vector distribution
   - Uniform Pareto front coverage
   - Improved spread metrics (Zitzler et al., 2003)

#### Practical Benefits
Drawing from supply chain optimization literature:

1. **Real-time Adaptation**
   - Fast convergence for dynamic environments
   - Efficient solution updates
   - Suitable for online optimization (Stadtler, 2015)

2. **Scalability**
   - Linear complexity with population size
   - Efficient parallel implementation
   - Handles large-scale problems (Deb et al., 2002)

3. **Integration Capability**
   - Compatible with existing systems
   - Flexible objective formulation
   - Modular architecture (Chopra & Meindl, 2007)

### 2. Comparison with Alternatives

#### NSGA-II
While NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002) is widely used:
- Higher computational complexity (O(MNÂ²) vs O(MNT))
- Less efficient for many objectives
- Poorer convergence in our tests

#### NSGA-III
NSGA-III (Deb & Jain, 2014) shows:
- Similar performance but more complex
- Higher parameter sensitivity
- More difficult to parallelize

#### Traditional Methods
Compared to classical approaches:
- Better handling of multiple objectives
- More flexible solution representation
- Superior Pareto front approximation

## Design Decisions

### 1. Population Structure

#### Size Selection
Based on empirical studies (Zhang & Li, 2007):
- 100 individuals balances diversity and efficiency
- Scales well with problem complexity
- Sufficient for Pareto front representation

#### Neighborhood Definition
Following Li & Zhang (2009):
- 20% neighborhood ratio optimal
- Balances local and global search
- Reduces computational overhead

### 2. Genetic Operators

#### Crossover Design
SBX chosen based on:
- Superior performance in numerical optimization
- Controlled spread factor
- Parameter-wise operation (Deb & Agrawal, 1995)

#### Mutation Strategy
Polynomial mutation selected for:
- Self-adaptive step size
- Boundary preservation
- Local refinement capability

### 3. Objective Formulation

#### Cost Function
Based on inventory theory (Silver et al., 2016):
- Holding cost: Linear with inventory level
- Backlog cost: Higher weight for stockouts
- Ordering cost: Fixed + variable components

#### Service Level
Following Graves & Willems (2003):
- Type 1: Probability of no stockout
- Type 2: Expected fill rate
- Combined metric for robustness

#### Bullwhip Effect
Based on Lee et al. (1997):
- Variance ratio measurement
- Window-based calculation
- Stability consideration

## Implementation Choices

### 1. Data Structures

#### Solution Representation
Real-valued vectors chosen for:
- Direct parameter mapping
- Efficient genetic operations
- Memory efficiency

#### Population Management
Array-based implementation for:
- Fast neighbor lookup
- Efficient sorting
- Cache-friendly access

### 2. Optimization Process

#### Update Strategy
Steady-state evolution because:
- Better convergence properties
- Lower memory requirements
- Suitable for parallel execution

#### Termination Criteria
Multiple conditions based on:
- Maximum evaluations
- Convergence measure
- Time constraints

### 3. Integration Design

#### ISN Interface
Designed following microservices principles:
- Clear API boundaries
- State encapsulation
- Asynchronous communication

#### Actor-Critic Integration
Based on hybrid system architecture:
- Parameter optimization
- Policy refinement
- Performance feedback
