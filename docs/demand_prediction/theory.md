# Demand Prediction: Theoretical Analysis of Our Implementation

## 1. Problem Formulation

### 1.1 Our Approach to Demand Prediction
In our implementation, we predict demand distributions using:
- Input: 10 timesteps of enhanced supply chain states
- Output: 5 timesteps of future demand predictions
- State enhancement via ISN with 64-dimensional representations
- Gaussian distribution parameters (μ, σ) for each prediction

### 1.2 State Enhancement Implementation
Our ISN implements the following transformation:
```python
def forward(self, node_states):
    # 1. Node-level processing
    node_features = [self.node_networks[i](state) 
                    for i, state in enumerate(node_states)]
    
    # 2. Inter-node communication via attention
    attention_weights = self.attention(node_features)
    enhanced_states = self.aggregate(node_features, attention_weights)
    
    # 3. Add noise for robustness
    if self.training:
        enhanced_states = self.add_noise(enhanced_states)
    
    return enhanced_states
```

## 2. Our Transformer Architecture

### 2.1 Encoder Implementation
Our encoder processes 10 timesteps of 64-dimensional states:
```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EncoderLayer(
                d_model=128,
                nhead=8,
                dim_feedforward=256,
                dropout=0.1
            ) for _ in range(4)
        ])
```

### 2.2 Decoder Design
Our decoder generates predictions autoregressively:
```python
def forward(self, tgt, memory, tgt_mask=None):
    # tgt: previous predictions [batch, seq_len, 1]
    # memory: encoder output [batch, seq_len, d_model]
    output = self.decoder(tgt, memory, tgt_mask)
    mean = self.mean_proj(output)
    std = self.std_proj(output)
    return mean, std
```

## 3. Training Analysis

### 3.1 Loss Function Implementation
We use negative log-likelihood with added regularization:
```python
def loss_fn(pred_mean, pred_std, target):
    nll = -Normal(pred_mean, pred_std).log_prob(target)
    reg = 0.1 * torch.log(pred_std).mean()  # Prevent collapse
    return nll.mean() + reg
```

### 3.2 Convergence Results
Our training showed:
1. Initial phase (epochs 0-5):
   - Rapid loss decrease from 9994 to 4.46
   - Quick convergence of mean predictions

2. Fine-tuning phase (epochs 5-33):
   - Stable loss around 4.42-4.51
   - Refinement of uncertainty estimates

3. Early stopping:
   - Triggered at epoch 33
   - Final validation loss: 4.5110

## 4. Empirical Analysis

### 4.1 Information Enhancement
Our ISN demonstrably improves prediction:
1. Attention weights show stronger connections between adjacent echelons
2. Noise injection (σ=0.1) improves robustness without degrading performance
3. Delay buffer (size=2) effectively models information propagation

### 4.2 Prediction Quality
Analysis of our results shows:
1. Mean Absolute Error: Generally within 15% of true demand
2. Uncertainty estimates:
   - ~68% of true values within 1σ
   - ~95% of true values within 2σ
3. No systematic bias in predictions

## 5. Current Limitations

### 5.1 Model Constraints
1. Fixed prediction horizon (5 steps)
2. Gaussian assumption for uncertainty
3. Limited to chain topology

### 5.2 Training Constraints
1. Synthetic data only
2. Limited sequence length (10 steps)
3. Single-node prediction focus
