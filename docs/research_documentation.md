# Supply Chain Optimization Research Documentation

## Project Overview

This research aims to develop an advanced supply chain optimization system that addresses key challenges in modern supply chain management, particularly focusing on:
1. Bullwhip effect mitigation
2. Service level optimization
3. Cost minimization

The research combines multiple cutting-edge approaches including transformers for demand prediction, actor-critic networks for decision-making, fuzzy logic for uncertainty handling, and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for parameter optimization.

## Literature Review and Methodology Justification

### 1. Supply Chain Environment Design

#### 1.1 Multi-Echelon Structure
Our implementation follows the standard multi-echelon supply chain model [1], which has been widely adopted in supply chain research. The key features include:

- **Inventory Management**: Based on the classical inventory theory [2], incorporating:
  - Continuous review policy
  - Order-up-to levels
  - Backorder handling

- **Cost Structure**:
  - Holding costs (h)
  - Backlog costs (b)
  - Transportation costs (t)
  This follows the traditional EOQ model extended for multi-echelon systems [3].

- **Lead Time Modeling**:
  - Stochastic lead times with normal distribution
  - Based on empirical studies showing lead time variability in real supply chains [4]

#### 1.2 Demand Generation
The current implementation uses a normal distribution for demand generation, which is supported by:
- Central Limit Theorem application in aggregate demand [5]
- Empirical studies showing normally distributed demand in various industries [6]

Future enhancements will include:
- Seasonal patterns
- Trends
- Promotional effects
- Random shocks

#### 1.3 Performance Metrics
Our performance evaluation framework includes:
1. Service Level (Î²)
   - Fill rate measurement
   - Based on SCOR model metrics [7]

2. Cost Components
   - Inventory holding costs
   - Backlog costs
   - Transportation costs
   Following standard supply chain cost modeling [8]

## Implementation Details and Design Decisions

### Environment Implementation (`supply_chain_env.py`)

#### State Space Design
The state space includes:
```python
obs_dim = (
    num_echelons +  # Inventory levels
    num_echelons +  # Backlog levels
    num_echelons +  # On-order inventory
    1 +             # Current demand
    1               # Average demand (as reference)
)
```

This design is based on:
- Information typically available in real supply chains [1]
- State observability requirements for RL [9]
- Proven effectiveness in similar studies [10]

#### Action Space Design
```python
action_space = spaces.Box(
    low=0,
    high=max_inventory,
    shape=(num_echelons,),
    dtype=np.float32
)
```

Justification:
- Continuous action space allows for fine-grained control
- Non-negative orders reflect real-world constraints
- Upper bound prevents unrealistic order quantities
