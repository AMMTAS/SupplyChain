# Transformer-Based Demand Predictor

## Overview
This document details the implementation of our transformer-based demand prediction model for supply chain optimization. The model is designed to capture complex temporal patterns in demand data while providing uncertainty estimates crucial for robust supply chain decision-making.

## Architecture Design

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1 Temporal Multi-Head Attention
Based on the original transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), with specific adaptations for time series:
- Local-global attention mechanism (Wu et al., 2020)
- Temporal bias for recent observations (Li et al., 2019)
- Memory-efficient implementation for long sequences

#### 1.2 Position Encoding
Enhanced temporal embeddings combining:
- Sinusoidal encoding (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- Learnable temporal embeddings (Kazemi et al., 2019)
- Seasonal decomposition features

#### 1.3 Uncertainty Estimation
Multi-faceted uncertainty quantification through:
- Monte Carlo Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016)
- Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017)
- Quantile predictions for asymmetric uncertainty

### 2. Design Decisions

#### 2.1 Model Dimensionality
- Embedding dimension (d_model): 512
- Number of attention heads: 8
- Number of layers: 6
- Feed-forward dimension: 2048

These values are based on empirical studies in time series forecasting (Wen et al., 2022).

#### 2.2 Input Features
- Raw demand values
- Temporal features (hour, day, week, month)
- Lagged features with adaptive selection
- Holiday and special event indicators

#### 2.3 Output Structure
- Point predictions
- Uncertainty intervals (50%, 80%, 90%, 95%)
- Attention weights for interpretability

## Implementation Details

### 1. Training Strategy

#### 1.1 Loss Function
Combination of multiple objectives:
```python
L = α * MSE + β * quantile_loss + γ * KL_divergence
```
where:
- MSE: Point prediction accuracy
- Quantile loss: Uncertainty calibration
- KL divergence: Regularization for uncertainty estimates

#### 1.2 Optimization
- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay
- Learning rate schedule: Warm-up followed by cosine decay
- Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients

### 2. Performance Metrics
Comprehensive evaluation using:
- Scale-dependent errors (MSE, MAE)
- Percentage errors (MAPE, sMAPE)
- Scale-free errors (MASE)
- Uncertainty calibration metrics
